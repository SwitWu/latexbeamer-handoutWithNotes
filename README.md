# handoutWithNotes.sty

Create Handouts with notes from your LaTeX beamer presentation.
This package provides pgfpages layouts to place notes next to the scaled slides.
By default the note area is empty providing rules for handwritten notes but with version 1.0 also beamer note pages can be used there.
