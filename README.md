# handoutWithNotes.sty

Create Handouts with notes from your LaTeX beamer presentation.
This package provides pgfpages layouts to place notes next to the scaled slides.
By default the note area is empty providing rules for handwritten notes but with version 1.0 also beamer note pages can be used there.



# Quickstart
To use this package load it in a document using beamer and select a layout:

Minimal example:
```
\documentclass{beamer}
\usepackage{handoutWithNotes}
\pgfpagesuselayout{3 on 1 with notes}
\begin{document}
â€¦
\end{document}
```

Currently the following layouts are implemented by this package:

- `1 on 1 with notes landscape`
- `2 on 1 with notes landscape`
- `1 on 1 with notes`
- `2 on 1 with notes`
- `3 on 1 with notes`
- `4 on 1 with notes`

Additionally we support the following package options:

- `slide-frame=true/false` draw a frame around the slides
- `note-frame=true/false` draw a frame around the note pages
- `beamer-notes=true/false` use beamer notepages instead of the area for handwritten notes
- `lines=<Number>` modify the number of lines in the notesbox (default is 8)
